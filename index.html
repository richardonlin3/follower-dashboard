        <h2>Current developments</h2>
        <p>
            The Social Media Dashboard project has made significant progress and is currently in the final stages of development. We look forward to releasing the first version of the software soon and sharing the benefits of this versatile tool with the community.  <br> <br>
<b>What Has Been Achieved </b> <br>

Over the past month (October 2023), we have worked hard to implement the core features of the dashboard. The platform integrations for Instagram and TikTok are well advanced, and the dashboard will soon be able to display follower counts, interactions, and other key metrics. <br>

The user interface has been designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. Real-time updates ensure that the displayed data is always up to date. <br> <br>
<b>What's Coming Next</b> <br>

We are currently working on implementing data from TikTok and Instagram. After that, we will perform final refinements and testing to ensure the dashboard operates smoothly and meets the needs of our users. Additionally, we are working on documentation to make using the dashboard as straightforward as possible. <br>

The project's release is just around the corner, and we can't wait to make it available to the world.
